1. 10.times{ puts "The Flintstones Rock!\n The Flintstones Rock!\n  The Flintstones Rock!"}
2. cannot concatinate integer value with string
   1) convert integer to string with .to_s
   2) use separate puts statements to print them out
3. see factors.rb
   1) to ensure that the divisor is really a factor and can be divided into the
   number
   2) to set the return value of the method as the array of factors
4. the second buffer does not work since assignment operator does not modify
calling object
5. the limit variable is outside the scope of the method and cannot be used,
since methods have their own scope 
6. 34
7. (WRONG)no, cannot the methods used are non-destructive and therefore cannot modify the hash
   indexed assignments do mutate the values, even if they are in hashes!!!

9. "no"
