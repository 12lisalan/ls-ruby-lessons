   4) not sure (ternary operator)
   5) indicates that the method returns a boolean

      return true (also turns object into boolean equivalent)
3. advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
   arr = advice.split
   arr[6] = 'urgent'
   advice = arr.join(' ')
   puts advice
   
   advice.gsub!('important', 'urgent')

5. (10..100).include?(42)
6. famous_words = "seven years ago..."
   words = "Four score and "
   famous_words = words + famous_words
   famous_words = "#{words}famous_words"
7. flintstones.flatten!
8. arr = ['Barney']
   arr.push(flintstones['Barney']
